## Competition Description
This competition focuses on predicting the progression of Parkinson's disease using clinical data, peptide abundance, and protein expression data. The goal is to predict UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) scores at different time points (0, 6, 12, and 24 months ahead) for four different UPDRS components (UPDRS 1-4).

**Metrics**: SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for each UPDRS component and time horizon.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Strategy Insight - The Winning Approach

**The fundamental breakthrough of this competition was recognizing that peptide and protein features had minimal or no predictive power.** This led to a completely different approach that ultimately secured the Gold Medal position.

### Core Strategy: Time-Based Progression Modeling

Instead of relying on complex biological features, the winning solution focuses on **disease progression patterns over time**:

1. **Single Feature Model**: The final model uses only the `visit_month` as a feature
2. **Disease Evolution Prediction**: Predicts how the disease will progress at 4, 6, and 12 months from each visit
3. **Temporal Logic**: A patient at month 12 (4 months from visit) will have worse prognosis than a patient at month 0 (4 months from visit = month 4)

### Multi-Model Architecture: 24 Specialized Models

The solution creates **24 separate models** based on two key dimensions:

#### Dimension 1: UPDRS Components (4 models)
- **UPDRS_1**: Non-motor experiences of daily living
- **UPDRS_2**: Motor experiences of daily living  
- **UPDRS_3**: Motor examination
- **UPDRS_4**: Motor complications

#### Dimension 2: Prediction Horizons (3 timeframes)
- **4 months ahead**: Short-term progression
- **6 months ahead**: Medium-term progression
- **12 months ahead**: Long-term progression

#### Dimension 3: Patient Stratification (2 categories)
- **"Good" Patients**: Visit all months (better prognosis)
- **"Bad" Patients**: Not visit in some months (worse prognosis)

**Total: 4 UPDRS Ã— 3 timeframes Ã— 2 patient categories = 24 specialized models**

### Why This Approach Won

1. **Biological Reality**: Peptides and proteins showed no meaningful correlation with disease progression
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Disease progression follows predictable time-based patterns
3. **Patient Heterogeneity**: Different visit patterns indicate different disease trajectories
4. **Model Specialization**: Each model focuses on a specific prediction scenario

### Example Prediction Logic

For **UPDRS_1 at 4 months**:
- Patient visiting at month 0 â†’ 4 months ahead = month 4 (better prognosis)
- Patient visiting at month 12 â†’ 4 months ahead = month 16 (worse prognosis)

This temporal understanding was the key to climbing the leaderboard and achieving the Gold Medal position.
